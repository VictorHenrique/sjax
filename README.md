# SJAX: Simplified JAX Framework

This is a simple [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) pseudo-framework built on top of Haiku's amazing [tutorial](https://dm-haiku.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/build_your_own_haiku.html).
It was built as a project to begin my studies with JAX and implementing several DL architectures/blocks from scratch.
It is not a serious framework, so please, don't try to use it on a real project.

Feel free to clone this repo, try it out and maybe add any additional functionality :)
